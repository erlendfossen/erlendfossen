Hi,

I am a research scientist currently doing research within the topic of climate and health. Previous projects involved developing and applying methods in statistics, bioinformatics and machine learning to study and predict survival and quality of life of cancer patients. I primarily use R for programming and analyses, but also have some experience with Python and bash.

My educational background is in evolutionary biology and ecology, where I regularly used R and occationally bash and Python for data management and analyses.  

Below is a list of the main repositories I'm a collaborator on: 
* [**SuPerTreat_GS_validation**](https://github.com/erlendfossen/SuPerTreat_GS_validation) (public): time-to-event (cox) models used to validate gene signatures as part of the SuPerTreat project, a project where analyses of big data is used to support personalized treatment decisions 

* [**ML_Beetles**](https://github.com/erlendfossen/ML_Beetles) (public): using machine learning (random forest) to classify species of beetles based on morphology

* [**PlasticityRNA**](https://github.com/erlendfossen/PlasticityRNA) (private): using differential gene expression analyses to quantify and study the evolution of phenotypic plasticity

* [**Hyperplasticity_package**](https://github.com/erlendfossen/hyperplasticity_package) (private): developing an R package for classification of phenotypic plasticity in an evolutionary setting

* [**Plasticity_bet-hedging**](https://github.com/erlendfossen/Plasticity_bet-hedging) (private): using animal models (Bayesian mixed effect models) and GLMs to quantify and study evolution of phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging

<!-- * [**OCBE: ISC-Bias**](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/ISC-Bias) (private): investigating the potential bias in model performance introduced under different imputation scenarios
