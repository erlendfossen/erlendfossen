Hi,

I am a data scientist currently working as a researcher in biostatistics and bioinformatics. My main projects involve developing and applying methods in statistics, bioinformatics and machine learning to study and predict survival and quality of life of cancer patients. I primarily use R for programming and analyses, but also have some experience with Python and Bash. I am currently teaching myself to become proficient in SQL and Python. 

My educational background is in evolutionary biology and ecology, where I regularly used R and occationally Bash and Python for data management and analyses.  

Below is a list of the main projects I'm a collaborator on: 
* [**OCBE: ISC-Bias**](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/ISC-Bias) (private): investigating the potential bias in model performance introduced under different imputation scenarios

* [**PlasticityRNA**](https://github.com/erlendfossen/PlasticityRNA) (private): using RNA data to quantify and study the evolution of phenotypic plasticity
